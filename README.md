# Human Development Index (GDP) - Supervised Learning
This project aims to study the relation of different factors that influences the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the country. 

The purposes of this data analysis project is to study the relation of all the variables listed below and also use machine learning to further predict the effects of those variables in relation to the HDI and GDP of the country.

List of Variables in the Case Study (Project)
Total Cases 
Total Deaths
Population
GDP Per Capita 
Location (Country)
HDI (Human Development Index)

For the machine learning, the dataset is split into 70% and 30%, where 70% of the data is used for training purpose and remaining for testing purpose. For further analysis and study, different models like Vanila Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression analysed, compared and validated with K-Fold Validation. 

In this data analysis, all the above mentioned models have similar RMSE score, that closely relates with each other explaining all the models are fit.
